# Notes App
Learning basics from flutter development, I tried to create to create Notes app, but was unsuccessful in completing, because I didn't know much about sqflite and how widgets should be added.
So before going into developing the app, first I created a High fidelity prototype, which I felt which is really cool and similar to iphone notes app them. So below is my prototype I created.

If you are willing to help me out in completing the app, thank you!!
