# Notes App
Learning basics from flutter development, I tried to create to create Notes app, but was unsuccessful in completing, because I didn't know much about sqflite database and how widgets tree structure should be added.
So before going into developing the app, first I created a High fidelity prototype, which I felt which is really cool and similar to iphone notes app them. So below is my prototypes I created with the link.
